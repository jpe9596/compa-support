# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: February 4, 2026**

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you use our mobile application ("the App").

We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring you have a positive experience using our App. This policy outlines our practices concerning the data we collect from users.

## Information We Collect

### Information You Provide

- **Sobriety Data**: If you use the sobriety tracking feature, we store your sobriety date and substance preferences locally on your device.
- **Chat Messages**: Conversations with AI companions are stored locally on your device to maintain conversation history.
- **Personal Preferences**: Any customizations or settings you configure within the App.

### Information Collected Automatically

- **Location Data**: When you use the AA/NA Meeting Finder feature, we request access to your device's location to find meetings near you. This data is used only for this purpose and is not stored or shared.

### Information Processed by Third Parties

- **AI Conversations**: When you chat with AI companions, your messages are sent to our secure server to generate responses. We do not store these conversations on our servers; they are processed in real-time and discarded.

## How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect to:

- Provide and maintain the App's functionality
- Find AA/NA meetings near your location
- Generate AI companion responses
- Improve and personalize your experience
- Send optional reminder notifications (if enabled)

## Data Storage

- **Local Storage**: Most of your data (sobriety dates, preferences, chat history) is stored locally on your device using Apple's secure storage mechanisms.
- **No Account Required**: The App does not require you to create an account, and we do not collect personal identifiers like email addresses or phone numbers.

## Third-Party Services

The App uses the following third-party services:

- **Supabase**: For secure API routing (no personal data stored)
- **HuggingFace**: For AI language processing (messages processed in real-time, not stored)

These services have their own privacy policies, and we encourage you to review them.

## Data Sharing

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personal information to third parties. Your data is used solely to provide App functionality.

## Data Security

We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction.

## Children's Privacy

The App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

## Your Rights

You have the right to:

- **Access**: View what data is stored on your device through the App
- **Delete**: Clear all locally stored data by deleting the App or using in-app reset options
- **Opt-Out**: Deny location permissions and still use other App features

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy in the App and updating the "Last Updated" date.
