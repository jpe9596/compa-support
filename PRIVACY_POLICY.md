# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: February 4, 2026**

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you use the Compa app ("the App").

We are committed to protecting your privacy. This policy outlines our practices concerning the data we handle.

## Information We Collect

### Information You Provide

- **Sobriety Date**: Your sobriety start date is stored locally on your device only.
- **Chat Messages**: Conversations with AI companions (Jennifer and Bob) are stored locally on your device.
- **Journal Entries**: Any diary entries you create are stored locally on your device.
- **Trigger Selections**: Your craving trigger tracking data is stored locally on your device.
- **Budget Data**: Any budget or financial tracking entries are stored locally on your device.
- **Diet Entries**: Any diet/nutrition tracking data is stored locally on your device.
- **MP3 Files**: Audio files you import are stored in the app's local documents folder on your device.

### Information Collected Automatically

**None.** This app does not automatically collect any data from your device.

### Information Processed by Third Parties

- **AI Conversations**: When you chat with AI companions, your messages are sent to our secure server to generate responses. Messages are processed in real-time and **immediately discarded** — we do not store your conversations on our servers.

## How We Use Your Information

We use the information solely to:

- Provide and maintain the App's functionality
- Generate AI companion responses
- Display your sobriety progress

## Data Storage

**All data is stored locally on your device.** Specifically:

- Sobriety dates → UserDefaults (on device)
- Chat history → UserDefaults (on device)
- Journal entries → UserDefaults (on device)
- Trigger tracking → UserDefaults (on device)
- Budget data → UserDefaults (on device)
- MP3 files → App Documents folder (on device)

**No Account Required**: The App does not require you to create an account. We do not collect email addresses, phone numbers, names, or any personal identifiers.

## Third-Party Services

The App uses the following third-party services for AI chat only:

- **Supabase**: Secure API routing (no personal data stored)
- **HuggingFace**: AI language processing (messages processed in real-time, not stored)

These services have their own privacy policies.

## Data Sharing

We do **not** sell, trade, or transfer your personal information to third parties. Your data stays on your device.

## Data Security

Your data is stored using Apple's secure storage mechanisms (UserDefaults and sandboxed Documents folder). Data never leaves your device except for AI chat messages, which are encrypted in transit and immediately discarded after processing.

## Children's Privacy

The App is not intended for use by children under the age of 17 due to its subject matter (addiction recovery). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## Your Rights

You have the right to:

- **Delete**: Clear all data by deleting the App, or use in-app reset options for specific features
- **Control**: All data is on your device — you have complete control

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted with an updated "Last Updated" date.
