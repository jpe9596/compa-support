# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: February 5, 2026**

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you use the Compa app ("the App"). Compa is a recovery companion app that handles **sensitive health-related information** including addiction recovery data. We are deeply committed to protecting your privacy.

## Information We Collect

### Information You Provide

- **First Name**: If you choose to share your name with the AI companions, it is stored locally on your device. Your first name is also sent to our AI service to personalize responses (see "AI Conversations" below).
- **Sobriety Date**: Your sobriety start date is stored locally on your device only.
- **Chat Messages**: Conversations with AI companions (Jennifer and Bob) are stored locally on your device.
- **Journal Entries**: Diary entries, morning pledges, and evening reviews are stored locally on your device.
- **Trigger Selections**: Your craving trigger tracking data is stored locally on your device.
- **Budget Data**: Financial tracking entries are stored locally on your device.
- **MP3 Files**: Audio files you import are stored in the app's local documents folder on your device.
- **Language Preference**: Your selected language (English or Spanish) is stored locally on your device.

### Information Collected Automatically

**None.** This app does not automatically collect analytics, crash reports, device identifiers, or any other data from your device.

### Device Permissions

The App may request the following permissions:

- **Notifications**: Used to send local reminders for morning pledges, evening reviews, and AI companion check-ins. All notifications are scheduled and triggered locally on your device — no remote push notification servers are involved.
- **Background Audio**: Used to continue music playback when the App is in the background.

### Information Processed by Third Parties

- **AI Conversations**: When you chat with AI companions, your messages, conversation history (last 6 messages), and first name (if provided) are sent to our secure server to generate responses. Messages are processed in real-time and **immediately discarded** — we do not store your conversations on our servers.

## Sensitive Health Information

This App handles information related to addiction recovery, including sobriety dates, substance use indicators, craving triggers, mood data, and journal entries about recovery. We treat all of this as **sensitive health information**:

- All health-related data is stored **exclusively on your device**
- Health data is **never transmitted** to any server (except AI chat messages, which are immediately discarded after generating a response)
- Health data is **never sold, shared, or used for advertising**

## How We Use Your Information

We use the information solely to:

- Provide and maintain the App's functionality
- Generate personalized AI companion responses
- Display your sobriety progress and milestones
- Send local reminder notifications for journaling

**No Account Required**: The App does not require you to create an account. We do not collect email addresses, phone numbers, or any personal identifiers beyond the optional first name you may share with the AI companions.

## In-App Purchases

Compa Premium subscriptions are processed entirely by Apple through StoreKit. We do not collect or have access to your payment information (credit card numbers, billing address, etc.). Subscription status is verified locally on your device through Apple's transaction system. Please refer to [Apple's Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/privacy/) for how Apple handles payment data.

## Third-Party Services

The App uses the following third-party services:

| Service | Purpose | Data Sent |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| **Supabase** | Secure API routing for AI chat | Chat messages, first name (processed in real-time, not stored) |
| **DeepSeek** | AI language model processing | Chat messages (processed in real-time, not stored) |
| **Apple StoreKit** | Subscription management | Managed entirely by Apple |

These services have their own privacy policies:
- [Supabase Privacy Policy](https://supabase.com/privacy)
- [DeepSeek Privacy Policy](https://www.deepseek.com/privacy)
- [Apple Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/privacy/)

## Data Sharing

We do **not** sell, trade, or transfer your personal information to third parties. Your data stays on your device except:

- AI chat messages and your first name (if provided) are transmitted to generate AI responses and are **immediately discarded** after processing

## Data Security

- All data on your device is stored using Apple's secure sandboxed storage mechanisms
- AI chat messages are encrypted in transit using HTTPS/TLS
- The DeepSeek API key is stored server-side (Supabase Edge Function) and is never exposed to the client app
- No personal data is stored on our servers

## Children's Privacy

The App is not intended for use by children under the age of 17 due to its subject matter (addiction recovery). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## Your Rights

You have the right to:

- **Delete All Data**: Clear all data by deleting the App from your device
- **Delete Specific Data**: Use in-app reset/delete options for individual features (clear chat history, delete diary entries, etc.)
- **Revoke Permissions**: Revoke notification access at any time through iOS Settings → Compa → Notifications
- **Opt Out of Name Sharing**: You can choose not to provide your name to AI companions
- **Full Control**: All data is on your device — you have complete control over it at all times

## Data Portability

Since all data is stored locally on your device, it is included in your standard iCloud or iTunes/Finder backups. The App does not currently offer a standalone data export feature.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted with an updated "Last Updated" date. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.
